[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a design of an adjustable DC power supply. A PC power unit is connected to it. There are 4 sets of outputs. The voltage of the first one is adjustable, from 0.5-30V. The rest of the 3 sets are 12V, 5V, and 3.3V. The DC-DC converter module, the power unit breakout board, and the binding posts are off-shelve components. You can follow the [instructions](Doc/Instructions.md) to build it.
