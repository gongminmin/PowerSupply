# Instructions

Here are the instructions for building a power supply module. The components are off-the-shelf parts bought online. They are assembled in a 3D printed case.

Step 1, 3D print the [front panel](/3DModel/Front.stl), snap the DC-DC converter on it and install 8 binding posts. Red ones are positive and black ones are negative. Each binding post has a wire out. The 2 below the DC-DC converter are connected to it.

Step 2, 3D print the [bottom panel](/3DModel/Bottom.stl), screw the breakout board to it.

Step 3, snap the bottom panel to the front panel. Connect wires from front panel to the breakout board. Now you can test it by connecting a PC power unit to it. This is the minimal set that can work.

Step 4, 3D print the [back panel](/3DModel/Back.stl), snap it to the bottom panel.

Step 5, 3D print the [left panel](/3DModel/Left.stl) and [right panel](/3DModel/Right.stl), screw them to the front, bottom, and back panels. Now the case should be stable.

Step 6, 3D print the [top panel](/3DModel/Top.stl), screw it to side panels. Note that it can be flipped open. Don't screw it too firm.

Step 7, print [labels](Labels.pdf) on paper, tap them to the front panel.

That's it. It's ready to use.
